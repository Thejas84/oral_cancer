Oral Cancer Prediction Using Hybridized Neural Network Model

**About the Project**

This project aims to develop a hybridized neural network model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the accurate prediction and classification of oral cancer. By leveraging the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the sequential pattern recognition strengths of RNNs, the model enhances the early detection and treatment outcomes for oral cancer, ultimately improving patient care.
